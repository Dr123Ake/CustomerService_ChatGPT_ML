Our goal is to build a sufficiently aligned AI system that can help us solve all other alignmentÂ problems.Justin Jay WangAugust 24, 2022AuthorsJan LeikeJohn SchulmanJeffrey WuSafety & AlignmentOur alignment researchÂ aims to make artificial general intelligenceÂ (AGI) aligned with human values and follow human intent. We take an iterative, empirical approach: by attempting to align highly capable AI systems, we can learn what works and what doesnât, thus refining our ability to make AI systems safer and more aligned. Using scientific experiments, we study how alignment techniques scale and where they willÂ break.We tackle alignment problems both in our most capable AI systems as well as alignment problems that we expect to encounter on our path to AGI. Our main goal is to push current alignment ideas as far as possible, and to understand and document precisely how they can succeed or why they will fail. We believe that even without fundamentally new alignment ideas, we can likely build sufficiently aligned AI systems to substantially advance alignment researchÂ itself.Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanityÂ and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together. Therefore we are committed to openly sharing our alignment research when itâs safe to do so: We want to be transparent about how well our alignment techniques actually work in practice and we want every AGI developer to use the worldâs best alignmentÂ techniques.At a high-level, our approach to alignment research focuses on engineering a scalable training signal for very smart AI systems that is aligned with human intent. It has three mainÂ pillars:Training AI systems using humanÂ feedbackTraining AI systems to assist humanÂ evaluationTraining AI systems to do alignmentÂ researchAligning AI systems with human values also poses a range of other significant sociotechnical challenges, such as deciding to whom these systems should be aligned. Solving these problems is important to achievingÂ our mission, but we do not discuss them in thisÂ post.We want to be transparent about how well our alignment techniques actually work in practice and we want every AGI developer to use the worldâs best alignment techniques.Training AI systems to do alignment researchThere is currently no known indefinitely scalable solution to the alignment problem. As AI progress continues, we expect to encounter a number of new alignment problems that we donât observe yet in current systems. Some of these problems we anticipate now and some of them will be entirelyÂ new.We believe that finding an indefinitely scalable solution is likely very difficult. Instead, we aim for a more pragmatic approach: building and aligning a system that can make faster and better alignment research progress than humansÂ can.As we make progress on this, our AI systems can take over more and more of our alignment work and ultimately conceive, implement, study, and develop better alignment techniques than we have now. They will work together with humans to ensure that their own successors are more aligned withÂ humans.We believe that evaluating alignment research is substantially easier than producing it, especially when provided with evaluation assistance. Therefore human researchers will focus more and more of their effort on reviewing alignment research done by AI systems instead of generating this research by themselves. Our goal is to train models to be so aligned that we can off-load almost all of the cognitive labor required for alignment research.Importantly, we only need ânarrowerâ AI systems that have human-level capabilities in the relevant domains to do as well as humans on alignment research. We expect these AI systems are easier to align than general-purpose systems or systems much smarter thanÂ humans.Language models are particularly well-suited for automating alignment research because they come âpreloadedâ with a lot of knowledge and information about human values from reading the internet. Out of the box, they arenât independent agents and thus donât pursue their own goals in the world. To do alignment research they donât need unrestricted access to the internet. Yet a lot of alignment research tasks can be phrased as natural language or codingÂ tasks.Future versions ofÂ WebGPT,Â InstructGPT, andÂ CodexÂ can provide a foundation as alignment research assistants, but they arenât sufficiently capable yet. While we donât know when our models will be capable enough to meaningfully contribute to alignment research, we think itâs important to get started ahead of time. Once we train a model that could be useful, we plan to make it accessible to the external alignment researchÂ community.LimitationsWeâre very excited about this approach towards aligning AGI, but we expect that it needs to be adapted and improved as we learn more about how AI technology develops. Our approach also has a number of importantÂ limitations:The path laid out here underemphasizes the importance of robustness and interpretability research, two areas OpenAI is currently underinvested in. If this fits your profile, please apply for our research scientistÂ positions!Using AI assistance for evaluation has the potential to scale up or amplify even subtle inconsistencies, biases, or vulnerabilities present in the AIÂ assistant.Aligning AGI likely involves solving very different problems than aligning todayâs AI systems. We expect the transition to be somewhat continuous, but if there are major discontinuities or paradigm shifts, then most lessons learned from aligning models like InstructGPT might not be directlyÂ useful.The hardest parts of the alignment problem might not be related to engineering a scalable and aligned training signal for our AI systems. Even if this is true, such a training signal will beÂ necessary.It might not be fundamentally easier to align models that can meaningfully accelerate alignment research than it is to align AGI. In other words, the least capable models that can help with alignment research might already be too dangerous if not properly aligned. If this is true, we wonât get much help from our own systems for solving alignmentÂ problems.Weâre looking to hire more talented people for this line of research!
